Originaly forked from https://github.com/Keith-Cancel/Anfilts-Factorio-Belt-Utilities. All credits for the initial mod goes to the original author.

Since the author had updated the mod more than 2 years before the fork and I had some ideas, I decided to try adding to it. I have yet to work on the mod, but I'll be listing all the features and what was made by whom when I manage to get to it.
